# Notes & future ideas for the scrip

# Getting 2 VARs from a file
cat file.txt |while read o n
 do echo $o $n
done

# Basic setup for mass_rename
ls *.mp4| while read line
do  echo $line
echo -e "$line \t $(echo -e  $line |sed "s/Word//")"
done

Use g to make changes globally Ex: echo -e "$line \t $(echo -e  $line |sed "s/Word//g" )"

to remove [ and ]
mv "$line" "$(echo -e "$line" |sed -e 's/\[//g' -e 's/\]//g' )"

# Script for making the dummy files
cat list.txt |while read line
do echo $line
touch "$line"
done

## Python script
I found this Python script online that does the same thing, ref: https://medium.com/@hannanmentor
/20-python-scripts-with-code-to-automate-your-work-68662a8dcbc1
```
# Python script to rename multiple files in a directory
import os
def rename_files(directory_path, old_name, new_name):
for filename in os.listdir(directory_path):
if old_name in filename:
new_filename = filename.replace(old_name, new_name)
os.rename(os.path.join(directory_path, filename), os.path.join(directory_path, new_filename))
```
